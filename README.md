- See a form validation message when trying to submit a blank form
- Play the audio file for a word when it's available
- Switch between serif, sans serif, and monospace fonts **(pending)**
- Switch between light and dark themes
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

### What I learned

I've been playing with React for a while, but I hadn't made a proper project because I felt like I needed to internalize how it works and how to best use hooks and stuff, and honestly, that's a lie. I used like 2 hooks besides a custom one I created using Context API and I was able to create this so, yay me. I'd also made a couple of personal projects with TailwindCSS, and even though it's pretty cool not having to think to hard about the styling, I'm not super in love with how messy the components look with all the class names you need to add.

### Continued development

This project is roughly 80% done. I still need to add a button/popover to the header so you can change the typography from sans-serif, to serif or to monospace. I also need to add tests and improve the accessibility.
